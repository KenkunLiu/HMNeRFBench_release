# **GeneHumanNeRF: Animatable and Generalizable Human NeRF from Monocular Videos**
![GeneHumanNeRF](assets/genehumannerf.png)



## Introduction  
We built a new generalizable and animatable method that takes a few monocular video frames as input, which is like an extension of HumanNeRF from the setting of per-scene trained into one-shot trained. 

**Codes are coming soon, please stay tuned...**
